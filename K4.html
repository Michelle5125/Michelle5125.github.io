  You decided not to kill the boy. A noble choice, but you aren't judged on your
  moral decisions. It's either kill or be killed.
</P>
<p>
  You quietly step backwards and circle around the boy to continue on your way
  to find a place to rest, but you don't come far. As soon as you're facing forwards
  you hear the sound of leaves rustling and twigs breaking. You realize the boy
  was faking it and the next moment, you can see the three tips of the boy's
  trident peeking out of your stomach.
