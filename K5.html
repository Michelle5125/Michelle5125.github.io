No, you think. Although you didn’t go into the arena by choice, you are going to leave this hellhole. Whatever it takes to achieve that. If the public wants you to play the game, you will.
</p>
<p>
As quiet as you possibly can be, you approach the boy. You are even holding your breath in fear of somehow awakening him. It feels wrong, attacking someone who isn’t even aware of the danger. But then again, these are the Hunger Games, where there is no place for remorse. With a knot in you stomach, you crouch down and pick up relatively large branch. Good enough to give someone a blow to their head and kill them. However, when you look up at the boy again, his eyes open and he quickly reaches for something beside him. You waste no time, swinging the branch as hard as you can and hit him on his temple with it. When you hear the sound of bone breaking, you wince. But it’s done. You know that because of the sound of a cannon shot echoing through the forest, marking his death. Taking a deep breath, you notice a shimmer in the corner of your eye. As you clear the leaves on the ground, you realize what the boy had been reaching out to. A trident. Looks like you didn’t even need to risk your life at the cornucopia after all.
</p>
<p>
Trying not to look at the boy’s body (if you do, you’re certain you’ll throw up) you take the trident and stand up again to continue searching for a safe place for the night. However, as soon as you look up, the boy is standing before you again. He isn’t alright though, his head wound still there with blood dripping out of it, staining his skin and clothing. Surprised, you blink, then can’t help but throw up. This is so messed up. “You killed me,” the boy whispers, suddenly standing next to you. Swallowing, you look up at him, only to see you have been surrounded by dozens of replicas of him. “You killed me!” they all scream. With your free hand you cover one of your ears to protect yourself from the sound, but it doesn’t help much. How is this possible? You turn around, looking at all the boys getting paler and more bloody the longer you stand here. They can’t be real. They’d have to be hallucinations.
