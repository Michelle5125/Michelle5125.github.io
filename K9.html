You push through the hallucinations of the boy which are still blaming you for his death or pleading for you to save him. “They’re not real,” you keep whispering to yourself. You just need a safe place where you can hide for the night and sit this out. Surely it wouldn’t last for the whole Games, as the Gamemakers did this sort of stuff every year. You’re lucky it is just hallucinations and not some mutant wolves chasing you.

After just a few minutes you stumble upon a dark hole in the ground that leads down into a cozy looking space. Good enough to spend the night, or even longer. Finally, something is going right, you think. You crouch down and lower yourself, holding onto the edge of the hole. Looking down at the soft grass which will break your fall, you let go, not realizing the grass was another hallucination as you fall down the pit of rocks.
