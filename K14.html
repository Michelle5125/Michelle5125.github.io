You curl your fingers around the reasonably sized stone at your side and as soon as the girl is within range, you lift it up and swing it at her. The rock is light enough for you to pick up, but heavy enough to do some damage. You manage to hit her head with it, but that girl’s tough. She grunts and falls back for a second, but then immediately gets up again, even though her head’s bleeding. If someone would’ve done that to you, you would’ve been knocked out. However, your fate it a bit more gruesome and painful than that. The girl places her boot on your chest, pinning you down. Then she grabs a fist of your hair, pulls your head up and slices it clean off with her sword.
