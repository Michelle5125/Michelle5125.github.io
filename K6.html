No, you think. Although you didn’t go into the arena by choice, you are going to leave this hellhole. Whatever it takes to achieve that. If the public wants you to play the game, you will. You got this trident for a reason.
</p>
<p>
With your knuckles turning white from grasping the trident to tightly, you take a deep breath. That’s when the boy’s eyes shoot open. “Please don’t–” he tries to plead, but you have already drilled the trident through his chest. You look away as you pull it out again, trying to keep your breakfast inside as the cannon shot marks his death.
</p>
<p>
You haven’t got much time to regain your composure though, as several voices and screams fill the arena the next moment, some awfully close to your location. Immediately you turn around only to see the boy you just killed standing in front of you. He isn’t alright though, the three holes in his chest are still there with blood dripping out of them, staining his clothing. Surprised, you blink, then can’t help but throw up. This is so messed up. “You killed me,” the boy whispers, suddenly standing next to you. Swallowing, you look up at him, only to see you have been surrounded by dozens of replicas of him. “You killed me!” they all scream. With your free hand you cover one of your ears to protect yourself from the sound, but it doesn’t help much. How is this possible? You turn around, looking at all the boys getting paler and more bloody the longer you stand here. They can’t be real. They’d have to be hallucinations.
