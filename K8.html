If they are hallucinations, you think, who knows what else you’re going to see? Even though it’s still dangerous, the best option is to stay right where you are and wait until they stop. You just have to endure the hallucinations until they stop.
</p>
<p>
What you did not expect, though, is how hard it would be to stay awake and on your feet for so long. To ignore the constant pleads and accusations of the boy, you are counting the minutes, but that causes time to pass even slower. Meanwhile, you feel exhausted. Your eyelids are heavy and your legs are on the point of buckling because you have been running and moving all day long, not to mention how mentally drained you feel right now. But you keep by your decision: you keep waiting. Even when eventually, a girl walks up to you. You get the instinct to run, but she looks totally deranged at the moment. She’s wildly looking around, just swinging with her sword and shouting random things. She doesn’t really seem to notice you, if you were to move it would probably catch her attention. So still, you stand still and wait. Even when her sword nicks your arm, sending a sharp sting of pain up to your spine. You wait.
</p>

<p>
A couple of days go by in which you barely manage to survive, in contrast to a lot of other tributes. You are among the last still standing, including three out of four careers. One of the girls died when the hallucinations were happening, you don’t know how though. You did manage to avoid the other three careers, which is an accomplishment in itself – or total luck – but you are hungry and you suspect that the cut the hallucinating girl made a few days ago has an infection.
</p>
<p>
“I miss potatoes,” you murmur whilst chewing on some clovers, which don’t taste good but helped you to not starve to death – at least for now. However, you stop chewing for a moment when you hear a loud voice echoing through the arena. A male voice announces that tomorrow, there will be a feast at the cornucopia with containers for each remaining district – filled with something they need.
