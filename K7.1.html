  You push through the endless versions of the boy dying, trying to get away and to go find a safe place where you can sit it out, but everywhere you look appears another one pleading for you to save him or blaming you for his death, until you come to a stop after bumping into something – or rather someone. You recognize the girl as one of the careers, but her face is flashing between female and the one of the boy, so you aren’t sure if it’s real or not. If she’s another hallucination or not. Until she begins to freak out, starting to scream and swing her sword at you. By trying to get away, you only make it worse. You still try to defend yourself with your trident amidst the chaos, but even though the girl is hallucinating, her fighting skills are still impeccable and she eventually manages to stab you, leaving you to bleed out.
