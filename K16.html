  You decided not to kill the boy. A noble choice, but you aren't judged on your moral decisions. It's either kill or be killed.
  </p>
  <p>
  You quietly step backwards and circle around the boy to continue on your way to find a place to rest, but you don't come far. As soon as you're facing forwards you hear the sound of leaves rustling and twigs breaking. You realize the boy was faking it and the next moment, an incredible pain soares through your head and through your spine, sending you to the ground. After that, the boy smashes your head with the large branch another time, which results in your death.
