You decide to wait. Even though you haven’t passed anyone on the way here, that doesn’t mean they’re here hiding too. It’s best to wait them out and see if it’s possible to get your bag when all the others are gone – or too distracted with each other to notice you.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t take long for the first tributes to run up to the table. Both the guy and girl from district one, who easily take their bag and disappear. No wonder, no one would want to mess with them, especially the both of them. They are the careers, so they’ve had years of training leading up to the Games. Although, there is still one other career alive, the girl from district two. She wasn’t with the district one tributes.
</p>
<p>
It takes another half hour or so until the next tribute takes his chance and runs for the table, only to be taken down by a few arrows moments after. As soon as the cannon shot goes off, the girl from district two now appears and sprints for the table. When she gets there, she throws it over and hides behind it, so that her back is faced to the cornucopia and her front is protected by the table. She’s only vulnerable from the sides, which is your angle of vision. At least, you can see her well enough to notice she isn’t only taking her container, but also stuffing yours in her bag. What the hell?
</p>
<p>
For a moment, you feel defeated. You have come all this way to the cornucopia, only to find out that a career is stealing your goods. There’s no way you’re going to win in a fight, which is exactly why you’re so lucky that she is heading in your direction when she’s done at the Feast. It seems like she doesn’t even know that you’re there, so you quietly move behind a tree which lines up with her path and wait. When the girl nears you, you can hear her footsteps and as soon as she passes your hiding place, you stab your trident in her back.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Two days go by and the medicine inside of your container has worked wonders. Your wound has completely healed and all the food that was inside of the career’s container has boosted your energy back up to high levels. Just in time for the finale… The final cannon shot had gone off just about ten minutes ago and half of the forest was now on fire. You guessed one of the careers had killed the other off, thinking that it would be easy to win from you. You don’t know if that’s going to be the case. Either way, the fire was supposed to lead you to the other tribute, so you could fight it out and the Games would be done with – for this year at least.
</p>
<p>
With your trident raised in your hand, you’re now face to face with the girl from district one, who you now recognize as the same girl who had cut you while hallucinating. You can see the sweat on her forehead and her breathing is heavy. She probably had to run further than you did, which perhaps gives you a slight advantage in this unfair fight. The fire wasn’t spreading anymore though. The Gamemakers are controlling it, leaving a circle for them to fight it out in. “You’re going down,” she snaps. “Sure, sweetie. Whatever you say,” you reply, rolling your eyes. If you were to die, it would be fitting your last words were sarcastic. The girl snarls and starts swinging her sword skillfully, while you try your best not to step into the fire and awkwardly dodge her attacks. You can’t even attack yourself, the only occupation your trident has at the moment is being the barrier between you and her awfully sharp sword – at least, until she hits it with such a hard blow that it flies out of your hands, followed by her foot against your chest. You land on your back in the grass, your head so close to the fire you can smell your hair burning. This can’t be it, you think as you frantically look around for something to defend yourself with. It doesn’t matter what it is, as long as it gives you a shot at surviving this.
