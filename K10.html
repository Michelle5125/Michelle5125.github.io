    After a long trip and nearly getting killed by someone again, you made it to the cornucopia, where there is now a table set up. On top of the table, you can see the containers numbered with the remaining districts, including yours. Surely there will be some food and medicine for your wound in there, but now that you’re looking at that wide open space, you begin to question your decision. Was it really a good idea to go here? You do have a weapon, but it’s risky to try to get your container. However, if you don’t go, you don’t know how long you’ll survive on clovers and dandelions and the dirty water of the small streams of rivers, not to mention that your wound is only getting worse and worse. You also didn’t see anyone on the way here and all the containers are still there, so this could very well mean that you are the first one to arrive.

  Basically, you have no choice but go. The question which remains though, is: should you go now or wait for the perfect time to try to get your container?
