    Adrenaline is rushing through your veins as you stumble into the forest surrounding
  the cornucopia, the trident in your hand. It is slick with blood - not yours though.
  You somehow managed to escape with a weapon and minimal harm. A few cuts and scratches,
  nothing more. However, there was a moment you thought it was already your end.
  When the 18 year old guy from district one spotted you, raised his bow and fired
  the arrow. You acted on instinct, pulling the person closest to you in front of
  you to protect yourself. It was that poor girl's trident you were carrying right now, dripping
  with... someone's blood.
</p>
<p>
  After you have wiped the blood off on your clothing (you don't want to leave
  any tracks), you make your way through the forest. It it not long until you
  already stumble upon someone. A boy. No more than fourteen years old, passed out
  against a tree. Your eyes shift to the weapon in your hand. It would be so easy
  to kill him right now it would also be so easy to just leave. Perhaps he'd be
  killed by someone else, but at least you won't have the blood on your hands.
