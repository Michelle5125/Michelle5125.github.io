It’s now or never, you think. After taking a deep breath, you sprint towards the table with containers, your eyes fixed on your district number. For a second you are convinced you are actually the first one to arrive here – that you can get to you container and escape without any troubles. Of course that would be too easy. You’re halfway to the table when suddenly there’s an incredible pain running through your back. Gasping, you continue running, breaking the back of the arrow off and throwing it on the ground. Turning back now is pointless. Not with an arrow in your back. The arrows, however, keep coming. Another one in your back. One in your leg. For a moment, you almost buckle from the pain, but you bite through it and keep on running – now more like walking. You already know you’re already dead, but you keep trying, and even more arrows rip through your flesh until finally, you imagine you look like a porcupine and you collapse.
