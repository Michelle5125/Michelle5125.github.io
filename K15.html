The girl has reached you and slams her sword down, but you manage to roll over just in time and when you stand up, you pick up a large branch to defend yourself with. It was lying in the fire, so all the leaves on the end of it were burning and the wood itself was hot enough to burn the flesh off of your hands, but you kept holding it. What were a few burned hands in comparison to death? The girl was looking at the branch in your hand with narrowed eyes, but she didn’t attack you again. What was she waiting for?
</p>
Then it hit you. When you met this girl before, while she was hallucinating, she had been afraid of something, just like you were. You couldn’t see what she was seeing, but you could hear what she was shouting. “It burns,” was one of those things, if you remember correctly. She’s afraid of fire. How convenient.
</p>
<p>
With your confidence returned, you hold the branch towards the girl. She snarls again – she really seems to love doing that – and begins to attack you again, but this time more carefully. She doesn’t want to get to close to the fire, the fear clear as day in her eyes. You manage to get to your trident and throw the burning branch in the grass before her, which immediately catches fire. The girl shrieks and jumps backwards, which is the perfect opportunity for you. Now that she lost her footing, she is more vulnerable, so you take your chance. You leap through the fire, stab her and push her with trident and all in the fire. As you watch her burn, you can’t help but feel bad.
</p>
<p>
You should feel happy. You’ve just won the Hunger Games. You’ll get to go home, see your family again – in contrast to the 23 other children who died. Three of which you killed. You guess that’s why you can’t shake the feeling that this isn’t the end of it. Even though you will leave the arena, you’ll never escape it. You can never bring back those children. Instead, you’ll now be forced to guide two new victims into their deaths every year until some other kid wins the Games.
</p>
<p>
It isn’t fame you get. It isn’t money. It isn’t glory or greatness. It’s just… life. Life for which others had to die. It makes you wonder whether “winner” is the correct word to use, when all you did was survive.
