At first, you are excited. The feast. That means there will be a container with medicine for your wound and perhaps even some food. You’ll be fit again. However, when you really start to think it through, doubt arises. You’ve seen the Games before, if you're not careful enough and don’t have enough fighting experience, it is a quick way to die. Besides, you are one of the last tributes. This means the Games will only last for a couple of more days, you’re sure you can survive those.

You were wrong.
