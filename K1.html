  As soon as the start signal goes off, you jump off of your platform and start
  running towards the forest surrounding you. Behind you, you can hear the awful
  sounds of battle. Cries of agony, the slashing of meat, the sickening excited
  yells of their killers, followed by the sound of a cannon shot marking the tribute's
  death. You can't get away fast enough and you don't stop running for a long time.
  Even when you do, you don't stay put. As you've got nothing to defend yourself
  with or to keep yourself safe and warm for the night, the best option is to stay
  moving. However, when night has fallen, sleep starts to catch up with you. All
  the terror and panic has taken its toll. Perhaps you should just rest for a bit.

  While you're searching for a safe place to do this, you can hear the forest
  growing quiet. Until finally, you abruptly stop. There, lying against the tree
  you can spot someone: a boy. Passed out. No more than 14 years, you're sure.
  It would be so easy to kill him right now it would also be so easy to just leave.
  Perhaps he'd be killed by someone else, but at least you won't have the blood
  on your hands.
