  "Sixty." The platform you're standing on has arrived in the arena. "Fifty."
  You blink, willing your eyes to adjust to the brightness of the sudden light.
  "Forty." You can see the other tributes standing in a circle around the cornucopia,
  which is filled with weapons and bags and food. "Thirty." Thirty seconds left to
  decide what you want to do. Go to the cornucopia, or to the forest surrounding it.
  "Twenty." If you run to grab a bag or even a weapon,  you are risking your life.
  Most tributes wihthout fighting experience don't make it out alive of the bloodbath.
  "Ten." You need to decide now. Run to safety, but risk being killed later in the
  game because you can't defend yourself. Or you can face the risk head-on, get it
  over with, and hope you survive. "One."
